I originally started this just as a way to give back to the world that is the family that was given to me, and to market my name and sort of create a persona for myself.



A target audience would be:

- Individual, curious people who love learning.

- Young, teenage, independent-minded, self-sufficient individuals who are in Jr High or High School, know a little bit about programming but want to know more.

- Very experienced programmers who get paid to write C# and Java (or Ruby on Rails!) have wanted to learn LISP, or go through SICP

- Adults who have a lot of time on their hands to learn something new

- Programmers of great experience who want to learn how to talk about what you already know.


There is a slight bias toward males. Sorry.
